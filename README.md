This Data Science project is focused in on the evolution of the 3 point shot within the NBA. It utilizes predictive analytics 
and machine learning models to try and answer 2 main questions:

1. Does a higher 3 point percentage for a singular player correlate to market value and salary. The project takes a deep dive into trying
to predict an individuals team value and salary based on 3 point shooting percentage

2. Will a team that shoots a higher 3 point percentage tend to win more games? This project utilizes many machine learning models to try
and predict whether a team wins or loses based solely on 3 point shooting.
